# Secure Messaging App

> The front end made in React Native with Expo <p> 
> The backend made with Node.js and mongoDB is seperate but still accessable, working on connecting the two

## Materials required
- Node.js version 10.16.3
- React Native version 2.0.1
- Expo version 3.9.1
- Git version 2.23

## Front End Setup

- In the project directory run npm install, which will install all the package dependencies.
- Then run expo start, which will bring up the Expo Devtools where you can run the app on either an android emulator or iOS emulator. If you can also download the expo app on your iPhone or Android to run the app.

## Backend Setup 
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run npm install to install all necessary node packages.
- Run ‘node timedeletion.js’ and leave it running in the background. This handles messages being deleted after a certain amount of time, which is 20 seconds by default.
- Run ‘node server.js’ and login to a user, (entering a new username and password that doesn’t exist will automatically create an account) and type in the recipient. That’s it!
